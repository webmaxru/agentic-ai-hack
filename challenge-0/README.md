# 1. Environment Creation and Resources Deployment
Welcome to your very first challenge! Your goal in this challenge is to create the services and enviornment necessary to conduct this hackathon. You will deploy the required resources in Azure, create your development enviornment and all the assets necessary for the subsequent challenges. By completing this challenge, you will set up the foundation for the rest of the hackathon. 

If something is not working correctly, please do let your coach know!


## 1.1 Preparation

Before you start, please fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the `Fork` button in the upper right corner of the repository's main screen (or follow the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)). This will allow you to make changes to the repository and save your progress.

## 1.2 Resource Deployment Guide
The first step on this hackathon will be to create the resources we will use throughout the day. You can deploy using either the one-click button or manual method below.

Before anything else, let's log in into the CLI with our account. Please paste the code underneath and follow the necessary instructions.

```bash
az login --use-device-code
```

## 1.2.1 Service Principal Setup (Optional - For Challenge 5)

**Note:** This step is only required if you plan to use Azure Functions in Challenge 5. If you're unsure, you can skip this step and proceed to deployment.

The Azure resources include optional service principal permissions that allow automated access to AI services. If you want to use these features:

### Option 1: Use an existing service principal
If you have an existing service principal (Client ID), run:

**Linux/macOS/WSL:**
```bash
./get-sp-object-id.sh YOUR_CLIENT_ID
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\get-sp-object-id.ps1 YOUR_CLIENT_ID
```

### Option 2: Create a new service principal
If you need to create a new service principal, run:

**Linux/macOS/WSL:**
```bash
# Create a new service principal and get its Client ID
CLIENT_ID=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "my-hackathon-sp" --query "appId" -o tsv)
echo "Created service principal with Client ID: $CLIENT_ID"

# Now get the Object ID using our script
./get-sp-object-id.sh $CLIENT_ID
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Create a new service principal and get its Client ID
$CLIENT_ID = az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "my-hackathon-sp" --query "appId" -o tsv
Write-Host "Created service principal with Client ID: $CLIENT_ID"

# Now get the Object ID using our script
.\get-sp-object-id.ps1 $CLIENT_ID
```

### Option 3: Skip service principal setup
You can proceed without a service principal by leaving the `servicePrincipalObjectId` parameter empty during deployment.

If you run into permission issues with the script, please run:
- **Linux/macOS/WSL:** `chmod +x get-sp-object-id.sh` first
- **Windows PowerShell:** Ensure execution policy allows scripts with `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

Save the Object ID value returned - you'll use it in the next step.

Now, time to deploy our resources to Azure!

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmartaldsantos%2Fagentic-ai-hack%2Fmain%2Fchallenge-0%2Fiac%2Fazuredeploy.json)

**Deployment Parameters:**
- **servicePrincipalObjectId**: If you completed the service principal setup above, paste the Object ID here. Otherwise, leave this field empty.
- **Other parameters**: You can use the default values or customize them as needed.

> **Note:** The **servicePrincipalObjectId** parameter is optional and only needed if you plan to use Azure Functions in Challenge 5 with service principal authentication. If you didn't complete the service principal setup above, simply leave this parameter empty during deployment.

Resource deployment can take up to 5 minutes due to one of the resources. Don't worry, after 2/3 minutes you'll be able to find most of the resources in your resource group.

In the meantime, you can proceed with the next step - opening a pre-configured development environment in GitHub Codespaces.

## 1.3 Development Environment

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code from anywhere. It provides a fully configured environment that can be launched directly from any GitHub repository, saving you from lengthy setup times. You can access Codespaces from your browser, Visual Studio Code, or the GitHub CLI, making it easy to work from virtually any device.

To open GitHub Codespaces, click on the button below:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/)

Please select your forked repository from the dropdown and, if necessary, adjust other settings of GitHub Codespace.

**NOTE:** If GitHub Codespaces is not enabled in your organization, you can enable it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/enabling-or-disabling-github-codespaces-for-your-organization), or, if you cannot change your GitHub organization's settings, create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home). The Github Free Plan includes 120 core hours per month, equivalent to 60 hours on a 2-core machine, along with 15 GB of storage.

## 1.4 Verify the creation of your resources

Go back to your `Azure Portal` and find your `Resource Group`that should by now contain 10 resources and look like this:

![alt text](image.png)

## 1.5 Let's retrieve the necessary keys
After deploying the resources, you will need to configure the environment variables in the `.env` file. Double check you have logged in into your Azure account on the CLI. If that's settled, let's move into retrieving our keys. The `.env` file is a configuration file that contains the environment variables for the application. The `.env` file is automatically created by running the following command within the terminal in your Codespace.

**Then run the get-keys script with your resource group name:**
```bash
cd challenge-0 && ./get-keys.sh --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
```

Replace `YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` with the actual name from the first command.

This script will connect to Azure and fetch the necessary keys and populate the `.env` file with the required values in the root directory of the repository.


## 1.6 Verify `.env` setup

When the script is finished, review the `.env` file to ensure that all the values are correct. If you need to make any changes, you can do so manually.

The repo has an `.env.sample` file that shows the relevant environment variables that need to be configured in this project. The script should create a `.env` file that has these same variables _but populated with the right values_ for your Azure resources.

If the file is not created, simply copy over `.env.sample` to `.env` - then populate those values manually from the respective Azure resource pages using the Azure Portal.

## Conclusion
By reaching this section you should have every resource and installed the requirements necessary to conduct the hackathon. In the next challenges, you will use these services to start strongly your Azure AI Agents journey.

Now the real fun begins!
