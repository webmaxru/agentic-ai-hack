# 1. Environment Creation and Resources Deployment

**Expected Duration:** 30 minutes

Welcome to your very first challenge! Your goal in this challenge is to create the services and enviornment necessary to conduct this hackathon. You will deploy the required resources in Azure, create your development enviornment and all the assets necessary for the subsequent challenges. By completing this challenge, you will set up the foundation for the rest of the hackathon. 

If something is not working correctly, please do let your coach know!


## 1.1 Fork the Repository

Before you start, please fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the `Fork` button in the upper right corner of the repository's main screen (or follow the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)). This will allow you to make changes to the repository and save your progress.


## 1.2 Development Environment

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code from anywhere. It provides a fully configured environment that can be launched directly from any GitHub repository, saving you from lengthy setup times. You can access Codespaces from your browser, Visual Studio Code, or the GitHub CLI, making it easy to work from virtually any device.

To open GitHub Codespaces, click on the button below:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/)

Please select your forked repository from the dropdown and, if necessary, adjust other settings of GitHub Codespace.

**NOTE:** If GitHub Codespaces is not enabled in your organization, you can enable it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/enabling-or-disabling-github-codespaces-for-your-organization), or, if you cannot change your GitHub organization's settings, create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home). The Github Free Plan includes 120 core hours per month, equivalent to 60 hours on a 2-core machine, along with 15 GB of storage.


## 1.3 Resource Deployment Guide
The first step on this hackathon will be to create the resources we will use throughout the day. You can deploy using either the one-click button or manual method below.

Before anything else, let's log in into the CLI with our account. Please paste the code underneath and follow the necessary instructions.

```bash
az login --use-device-code
```

## 1.3.1 Resources Deployment

Now, time to deploy our resources to Azure!

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmartaldsantos%2Fagentic-ai-hack%2Fmain%2Fchallenge-0%2Fiac%2Fazuredeploy.json)

**Deployment Parameters:**
- servicePrincipalObjectId: Leave this field empty.
- resource group: Introduce the unique name for your resource group (defined above).

**NOTE:** Some parts of your deployment may fail if the resource provider `Microsoft.AlertsManagement` is not registered in your. Follow the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1) to register it and the re-run the deployment.

Resource deployment can take up to 10 minutes, afterwards you'll be able to find most of the resources on your resource group. In the meantime, you can proceed with the next step - opening a pre-configured development environment in GitHub Codespaces.

## 1.4 Verify the creation of your resources

Go back to your `Azure Portal` and find your `Resource Group`that should by now contain 9 resources and look like this:

## 1.5 Let's retrieve the necessary keys
After deploying the resources, you will need to configure the environment variables in the `.env` file. Double check you have logged in into your Azure account on the CLI. If that's settled, let's move into retrieving our keys. The `.env` file is a configuration file that contains the environment variables for the application. The `.env` file is automatically created by running the following command within the terminal in your Codespace.

**Then run the get-keys script with your resource group name:**
```bash
./get-keys.sh --resource-group YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
```

Replace `YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` with the actual name of the resource group created on step 1.3.

This script will connect to Azure and fetch the necessary keys and populate the `.env` file with the required values in the root directory of the repository.

## 1.6 Verify `.env` setup

When the script is finished, review the `.env` file to ensure that all the values are correct. If you need to make any changes, you can do so manually.

The repo has an `.env.sample` file that shows the relevant environment variables that need to be configured in this project. The script should create a `.env` file that has these same variables _but populated with the right values_ for your Azure resources.

If the file is not created, simply copy over `.env.sample` to `.env` - then populate those values manually from the respective Azure resource pages using the Azure Portal.

## Conclusion
By reaching this section you should have every resource and installed the requirements necessary to conduct the hackathon. In the next challenges, you will use these services to start strongly your Azure AI Agents journey.

Now the real fun begins!
