            "COVERED: The motorcycle insurance policy offers several coverage options tailored for motorcycles and two-wheel vehicles, as outlined in Sections 1 through 3 of the motorcycle_policy.md document. Coverage includes Liability Coverage (Section 3.1) for bodily injury, property damage, legal defense, medical expenses, and compensation for lost wages and pain and suffering. Physical Damage Coverage (Section 3.2) is divided into Collision Coverage (Section 3.2.1) for damage from accidents including single-vehicle crashes, road hazards, and parking lot incidents, and Comprehensive Coverage (Section 3.2.2) for theft, vandalism, fire, weather damage, falling objects, and animal collisions. The policy also specifies which types of motorcycles are eligible (Section 2.1), from street motorcycles to electric and vintage bikes. Relevant exclusions include racing, commercial use, intoxicated or reckless riding, and off-road riding unless specifically covered. Deductibles and limits are detailed within these sections, and additional benefits may include replacement cost coverage. You should review the specific sections for exact limits and deductible amounts to understand your policy’s financial responsibilities and exclusions fully. If you need coverage for excluded risks like racing or off-road riding, inquire about endorsements or separate policies to fill these gaps【3:0†motorcycle_policy.md】【3:2†motorcycle_policy.md】【3:1†motorcycle_policy.md】.\n"
