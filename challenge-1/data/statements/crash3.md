Description of Incident
On July 19, 2025, at approximately 6:30 PM, I was operating my 2012 Suzuki SX4 eastbound on East 8th Street. As I slowed to make a left turn into a residential driveway, another vehicle traveling at excessive speed attempted to overtake my car on the left and collided forcefully with the rear driver’s side quarter panel.

The impact caused my car to spin and strike a nearby curb, resulting in further damage to the front bumper and left front wheel. I remained on the scene and called emergency services. The at-fault driver remained present and admitted fault to the responding police officer. The event was witnessed by a neighbor, Mr. Richard Talbot, who has provided a written statement.
