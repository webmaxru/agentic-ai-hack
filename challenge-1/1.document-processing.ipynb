    "# Document Processing with Azure OpenAI Multimodal Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to process insurance documents using Azure OpenAI's multimodal GPT-4o model, including both text and image analysis. The workflow includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Upload Data to Azure Blob Storage**: Upload insurance policy documents (.md files), claim statements (.md files), and crash images (.jpg/.png files) to Azure Blob Storage containers for organized processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Documents with Azure OpenAI GPT-4-1-mini**\n",
    "   - **Text Processing**: Prepare markdown files containing insurance policies and claim statements for vectorization\n",
    "   - **Image Analysis**: Use GPT-4o's vision capabilities to generate detailed descriptions of crash scene images, analyzing vehicle damage, environmental conditions, and relevant details for insurance claim processing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract Structured Information**: Utilize Azure OpenAI's structured output capabilities to extract key information from claim statements into structured JSON format, including policyholder details, incident information, vehicle data, and witness information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Store in Azure Cosmos DB**: Save the processed and structured claim information to Azure Cosmos DB for easy retrieval and analysis by insurance agents and automated systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Retrieve Information in JSON Format**: Generate comprehensive JSON outputs containing both structured claim data and detailed image descriptions, ready for downstream processing like vectorization and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automating document processing is crucial for improving efficiency and accuracy in handling large volumes of data. By leveraging Azure's cloud services, organizations can streamline their workflows, reduce manual errors, and gain valuable insights from their documents. This approach not only saves time and resources but also enhances data accessibility and decision-making capabilities.\n",
